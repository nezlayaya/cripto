                <h4>Althusser Competing Interpellations And The Third Text</h4>
                <p>What is the loop of Creation? How is there something from nothing?
                    In spite of the fact that it is impossible to prove that anything exists
                    beyond one’s perception since any such proof would involve one’s perception
                    (I observed it, I heard it, I thought about it, I calculated it, and etc.),
                    science deals with a so-called objective reality “out there,” beyond one’s
                    perception professing to describe Nature objectively (as if there was a Nature or
                    reality external to one’s perception).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shocking impact of Matrix was precisely the valid possibility that
                    what we believed to be reality was but our perception; however, this was
                    presented through showing a real reality wherein the perceived reality
                    was a computer simulation. Many who toy with the idea that perhaps, indeed,
                    we are computer simulations, deviate towards questions, such as, who could
                    create such software and what kind of hardware would be needed for such a feat.
                    Although such questions assume that reality is our perception, they also
                    axiomatically presuppose the existence of an objective deterministic world
                    “out there” that nevertheless must be responsible for how we perceive our reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a major mistake emphasizing technology and algorithms
                    instead of trying to discover the nature of reality and the
                    structure of creation. As will be shown in the following,
                    the required paradigm shift from “perception is our reality
                    fixed within an objective world,” to “perception is reality without the
                    need of an objective world ‘out there,'” is provided by a dynamic logical
                    structure. The Holophanic loop logic is responsible for a consistent and
                    complete worldview that not only describes, but also creates whatever can
                    be perceived or experienced.
